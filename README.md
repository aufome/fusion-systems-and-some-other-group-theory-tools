# Fusion Systems and Some Other Group Theory Tools

This repository provides tools and functions for working with fusion systems on finite p-groups. It is designed for both theoretical exploration and computational experiments in group theory and fusion systems.

## Features

### Construct Fusion Systems:

- Create a fusion system of a given group realized by another group.

- Generate all saturated and non-saturated fusion systems on a given p-group.

### Characteristic Biset Construction:

- Given a saturated fusion system, construct its characteristic biset.

### Fusion System Functions:

- Compute various properties and invariants of fusion systems such as F-centric, F-radical, F-essential subgroups, fully F-normalized and fully F-centralized subgroups, F-automorphism groups, F-conjugacy relations, and many more related properties.

### Group-Theoretic Utilities:

Provides additional functions related to group theory that are not included in the standard GAP library.
